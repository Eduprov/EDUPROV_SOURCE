            <b>Petroleum Engineering</b> is a rare course and is not available in most of the engineering colleges
            Only few intakes are done every year. Since there will be only less number of candidates who will
            pass out every year the scope for this course is high and will not diminish in the future too. 
            In case of learning it will explore you to a new world and will be adventurous. So choosing the 
            course will be a wise choice.

            <b>Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.)</b>  or Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Petroleumis an 
            <b>undergraduate course</b> for the study of science and technologies related to extraction, 
            production, refining and consumption of hydrocarbons (crude oil and natural gas). The 
            course is offered in engineering colleges for the duration of four years which include 
            a semester of internship as well. After completing this course successfully, the student 
            is conferred B.Tech/B.E. in Petroleum and is mostly referred as a petroleum engineer.

        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
            The course subjects are essentially divided into three main divisions out of which the 
            first one is mainly taught in the first year while the second and third category which 
            cover the technical aspects are covered in subsequent years.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The basic fundamentals of engineering include Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, geology, thermodynamics, etc</li>
            <li>The Upstream sector includes the exploration and production of petroleum and natural gas</li>
            <li>The downstream Sector includes refining of the hydrocarbons and their marketing.</li>

                To get admission to an Engineering college, there are two main competitive 
                exams held nationwide. JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) is conducted for getting admission 
                to IIT’s. AIEEE (All India Engineering Entrance Exam) for getting admissions is NITs 
                and other premier institutes of India.

                Both the private 
                and public sectors have a huge demand for petroleum engineers. They are employed as a
                 reservoir engineer, Drilling Engineers, Safety inspectors, Officers in various Oil 
                companies, Production engineers, etc.  One can also opt for the teaching profession 
                 in college by pursuing a Masters's Degree or Ph.D. Petroleum Engineers enjoy a high 
                 demand overseas especially in the Gulf region and UAE.
