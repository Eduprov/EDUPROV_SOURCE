            <b>Mining engineering right</b> from the name you can know what the course is about. Yes!! 
            If you choose this course you will be a <b>mining engineer </b>where you will apply the latest 
            technology and science to extract the minerals from the earth. While following the course, 
            you study some basic subjects like <b>physics, geology, chemistry, environmental studies,
            mathematics and economics</b> followed by technical subjects like <b>mine design, mine ventilation, 
            mineral processing, surveying, rock fragmentation, rock mechanics and resource law.</b> Mining 
             engineering also helps in converting an exhausted mine site into a safe and livable habitat.

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
            <b>Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.)</b> or Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Mining is an 
             undergraduate course for the study of science and technologies related to the extraction 
             and location of minerals beneath the earth safely and efficiently. The duration of the course
             is 4 years offered in engineering colleges. After completing this course successfully, the 
             student is bequeathed with an engineering degree in Mining. Like genetic or marine engineering 
             this course is not common.  From this, you can know that this course is not available in all 
             engineering colleges. Only a few colleges offer this course but this course has a good scope. 
             We at <b>EDUPROV</b> have a separate panel where they will guide you about the colleges that provide
              this course along with the ranking of the institution.

            To get admission to an Engineering college, there are two main competitive exams held nationwide. 
            JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) is conducted for getting admission in IITâ€™s and ISM (Indian School of 
             Mines). AIEEE (All India Engineering Entrance Exam) for getting admissions is NITs and other 
            premier institutes of India and other state wise entrance exams for getting admissions.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
            There is a rank wise counseling conducted and seats are allotted strictly as per merit basis. 
            No need to worry about the counseling or the entrance exam since our professionals are there

                <b>Mining Engineering</b> has a very broad scope in India. <b>Mining Engineers</b> are well employed 
                in the mining sectors fulfilling the roles of <b>mines inspector, mine designer, technician, 
                supervisors and safety inspectors.</b> Some of the posts like mining engineers, geotechnical
                engineers, and mining technicians are also in demand. A Mining Engineer can also work as 
                 a lecturer in the engineering college, but to get on to higher levels one must procure the
                degree of <b>M.E./M.Tech in mining or Ph.D./ doctoral degree.</b>
