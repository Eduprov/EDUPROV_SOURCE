            knowledge in this
            course which will help for <b>cargo operation, maintenance of ships and navigation.</b> The course will also
            provide some knowledge
            about social studies and humanities. In this course, one will be trained in areas like <b>boat handling, rope
              climbing, and ladder
              climbing and sailing.</b> 
            </p>

              one that suits you the best.
              One can become a <b>ship engineer if he chooses the marine engineering. </b>In the case of Nautical science,
