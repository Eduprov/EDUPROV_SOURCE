                Before taking up any course/career, the usual question that arises in every person’s mind is the scope of that course/curriculum; questions like, “Can I get a job after this course?” and “What are the areas of diversification after finalizing this course?”
               </p>
               <p>
                After finishing B. Ed, there are a lot of possibilities to get employed in government, in addition to private schools, with a decent salary package. The remuneration depends upon your post in the school.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you are economically strong and have the ability to run a school, then the second option is to open your own school. In the beginning, you can start a lesser school and afterward, with the help of loans and finances of banks and other financial institutions you can expand it to set up a new, bigger school.
               </p>
               <p>
                Interested aspirants can also follow higher studies after completing B.Ed. They can pursue M.Ed or Master of Education, which is the higher specialized postgraduate course after the accomplishment of B.Ed. After successful completion of M.Ed., students can do a Ph.D.
               </p>
               <p>
                Teaching is a respected profession in this country and also in the entire world. There is a demand for teachers both government and private sectors. After completion of B.Ed, candidates shall be entitled to get employment in secondary as well as higher secondary schools. With a B.Ed degree candidates can get jobs in Schools, Coaching Centers, Education consultancies, Education departments, private tuition, etc. The remuneration will be augmented with a decent experience and accomplishment in the field of education.
