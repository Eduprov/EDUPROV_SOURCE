          <b>B.Tech Infrastructure Engineering</b> deals with the concept of creating a better infrastructure of
          buildings, roads, transportation routes, townships, environmental issues, and various others.
          During the course of study, a student learns how to tackle extreme situations. There are regular
          classes with field projects to give a deeper sense of understanding about the course. By the
          name of the course <b>Infrastructure Engineering,</b> you may come to the conclusion that this course
          is the same as the civil engineering. Doing <b>Infrastructure engineering and civil engineering</b> is
          the same. But both are different. All infrastructure engineers are civil engineers, but all civil
          engineers are not infrastructure engineers. A civil engineer to be an infrastructure engineer want
          to do a master's in infrastructure engineering.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Within the duration of the course, the framework is adopted for emphasizing on the operations of
          <b>connected infrastructure, designing, planning, and management.</b> There are other environmental factors
          like wind, geography, and water that have to consider while working. In this field, there is always a
          term for bringing new innovation and changes in <b>infrastructure.</b> More information about the course and
          the institutions which provide this course can be obtained in detail from the <b>EDUPROV's expert</b> when you
          reach/contact us.
