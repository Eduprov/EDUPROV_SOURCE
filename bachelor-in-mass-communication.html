          One can pursue this course at both levels, one at graduation and second at post-graduation.
          This course seldom requires any stipulation other than the good communication skill. Here is
          the list of a few things that one needs to have to commence the journey in this line.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <label>For Graduation level:</label>
          <li>One needs to have a passing certificate of high school and
            intermediate and if going to the renowned colleges,</li>

          This course is not at all confined as it has got so many branches and the future of this
          course is quite perforating but it requires the working people, who should have the capability
          to work with dedication. In the national arena, this course is getting viral as the news and
          articles have become an essential part of everyoneâ€™s life. These things keep people up-to-date
          about daily matters and whatever is happening in the world. From the international point of view,
          this is a great opportunity for those, who have a great command of their accent and words as
          there are so many countries that invite the intriguing writers, who can write about the burning
          issues.

          <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
            If one is trying for an internship, then they can find a very less pay scale as people don't
            wish to pay more in the initial stage and probably one will be hired at 10k monthly. If
            direct placement is there then one might get 20k to 35k per-months. If one gets the perfect
            platform like the big news channels, then no need to think of money as there one gets the
            name and fame both the things in hand. So, this line is quite interesting for the adventurous
            people, if you have the dare then tries it.
