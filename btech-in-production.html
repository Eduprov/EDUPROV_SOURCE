            It is a blend of <b>manufacturing, engineering technologies, and management.</b> The main 
            aim role of a <b>production engineer</b> is to develop efficient processes related to turning 
            raw materials to finished products. An aspirant has a wide knowledge of <b>engineering 
            practices</b> and has awareness about production-related management challenges. Production 
            engineers are responsible for the production process. This branch of engineering overlaps 
            certain other courses such as manufacturing engineering and industrial engineering.  
            The scope of the course is high and the one who chooses this course can shine in the 
            country and outside the country too.

           <b> Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.)</b> or Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in productionis
            an <b>undergraduate course</b> pursued in an engineering college for a duration of 
            four years. During the first year, of course, students deal with the fundamental subjects 
            like Mathematics, Physics, and chemistry, Engineering materials, thermodynamics, mechanics, 
            industrial statistics, etc followed by core technical subjects such as Project Planning, 
            Manufacturing Plastics, and ceramics, terotechnology, ergonomics, Non- Destructive Testing, 
            quality circle, and work motivation, etc. After completing this course successfully, the 
            student is conferred <b>B.Tech/B.E. in Production Engineering</b> as mostly referred to as a 
            production engineer

                There are two main nationwide competitive entrance exams conducted. For taking admissions
                 into IITs, one needs to qualify in <b>JEE (Joint Entrance Exam). For NITs, AIEEE (All India 
                 Engineering entrance exam)</b> should be cleared with a good rank. Some state colleges take 
                 the merit of AIEEE, while some take their own exam.

                One can also get into Software Company or consultancy with his excellent coding and 
                analytical skills. One can also opt for the teaching profession by pursuing<b>M.E. /
                 M. Tech in production engineering</b>. <b>Production engineers</b> enjoy more demand in
