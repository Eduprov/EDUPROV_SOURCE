            The name <b>power engineering</b> will make you guess that it is the branch of electrical engineering
            Yes!! your guessing is correct but you won't study purely about electrical engineering you will 
            know about mechanical engineering too. Power engineering is a subdivision of electrical 
            engineering and is essentially a blend of mechanical and electrical engineering. The branch of 
            engineering deals with the transmission, generation, and distribution of power via various 
            devices connected to generators, transformers, inverters, etc...!

        <p class="text-justify" id="paragraph-font">
            <b>Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.)</b> or Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Power is an 
            undergraduate course for the duration of four years which includes a semester of an 
            internship as well. After completing this course successfully in an engineering college
            the student is conferred the degree ofB.Tech/B.E. in Power Engineering as mostly referred 
            to as a power engineer. Students opting for power engineering are taught on various subjects 
            such as Electrical machines, power electronics, switch Gear and protection, power generation,
            power transmission, and power distribution, etcâ€¦

                To become a power engineer you need to qualify for certain national level exams like 
                AIEEE and JEE for NITs and IITs respectively or clear state competitive exams for state 
                engineering colleges.
