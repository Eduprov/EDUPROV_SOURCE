          <strong>Bachelor of Science in cardiac care technology or Bachelor of Science in cardiac technology</strong>
          is commonly known as
          <strong>B.Sc in cardiac care technology </strong>is a three years long allied health sciences undergraduate
          degree that enables the
          student to work in the field of health care as a <strong>cardiac care technician.</strong> They are
          <strong>medical professionals</strong> that assist
          physicians during cardiac testing and invasive procedures where a tube has to be inserted into the blood
          vessels.
          After the insertion of the catheter by the surgeon, the cardiac care technicians need to monitor the blood
          pressure
          and heart rates of the patient to look for signs of trouble and distress. The cardiac care technicians during
          the
          <strong>B.Sc course</strong> have to learn both medical procedures in practicals along with their theory.
          The course also includes a six-month-long internship to get more hands-on experience.
