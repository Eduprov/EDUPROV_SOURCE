          A development that is showing a great impact on the world in terms of growth is now simply reflecting the
          adverse impact onhuman health.Earlier the people used to say ‘health is wealth’, but now

          synonymous with wealth, the term ‘health’ is gone. The health is deteriorating and people nowadays
          don't have the
          time to spend time in consulting about health. So, there is a great requirement of the Pharmacist, who can
          assure
          that what medicines are required for the particular disease so that you don't have to spend too much time
          thinking
          that what you have to do at the adversary time.
