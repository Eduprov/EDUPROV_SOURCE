              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              The admission process is very simple for B.Tech Fire and Safety Engineering. Students can attend entrance exams or get in direct admissions. 
              Entrance exams are conducted state level, national level and there are also some private institutions which conduct their own entrance exams 
              which are university level entrance exams. The student needs to firstly apply to whichever institute they want to get into which is offering 
              the prescribed course. And then they can attend any entrance exam which will be listed below. Then after the results are out, candidates will 
              be called for counseling sessions and personal interviews for those who were shortlisted with good ranking and seat allotment is done. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
                Then the other method will be merit quota. Colleges will release a merit list for students who have scored merit in their qualifying exam. 
                Some colleges also offer seats based on management quota in which the fees will be really high and students can apply directly on the college 
                portal and after the document verification can proceed for admission further.
              </p>
