          <b> B.Tech Safety and Fire Engineering</b> is a life-saving course in the field of engineering.
          Within the course, an aspirant will understand how to tackle conditions in an exclusive time.
          The course teaches how to take precautions and make an instant decision when the problem occurs.
          It refers to the precautions against the fire and others to access the safe. This education is
          not provided by a large number of colleges or institutions in India. There are few colleges or
          institutions which are providing the various courses in the field of fire and safety. It seeks
          to provide a fool-proof method of designing buildings and facilities for life safety and
          property protection in the event of an unwanted fire. It is a very dangerous profession
          that requires a strong sense of commitment to public service.

          The candidate having the skills is liable to work in dangerous areas involving heavy fire.
          The scope of the job is in government and private sectors. There are much higher chances of
          getting hired by the manufacturing plant, multinational industries, Rigs plant, refinery,
          the airline industry and few more. A degree holder is also having the ultimate chances of
          working with abroad companies. Safety precautions are now mandatory in all establishments.
          There is plenty of jobs in fire and safety field. Safety is an integral part of our daily
          life.
