            A <b>BSW degree holder</b> has its own specialization after the completion of the course.
            Still, there are various open fields in which they can work. The specialist in medical
            and psychiatric is able to join counseling centers, clinics, mental hospitals, old age
            homes, hospitals. A criminology specialist is able to work in criminal rehabilitation,

            One of the best qualities about this degree is that a person can easily work with international
            organizations like UNICEF, WHO or UNESCO. Another best thing about these organizations is that
            they come to the country with various plans and camps. A degree holder can easily reach them and
            work with them and they are also in need for locals to join with them.

            It was used to be known that the salary of a social worker is very low because they work
            for the benefits of others. But with the coming of corporate individuals and different
            program criteria, the salary has increased. The salary will be increased as the experience
            level of a person increases.
